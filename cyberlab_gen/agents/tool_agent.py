"""The reusable tool-using agent contract — the six-step emit sequence, owned once.

Architectural source: ``architecture.md §1.5`` (LLMs produce content / structured judgments;
the framework owns control flow), ``agents.md §5.4``/``§5.5``. ADR 0072.

Both Phase-1 typed-output agents — the Extractor (``output_type=AttackSpec`` /
``RefinementPatch``) and the Extractor-Jury (``output_type=JuryVerdict``) — drive a tool loop over
the *same* registries and the *same* (Extractor) tool inventory, and each hand-rolled the identical
six steps: type-guard the registries, derive the registered source ids, build the
``ExtractorToolExecutor``, build the system+user messages, ``run_with_tools``, and read back the
typed response. That copy-paste is exactly where the ``§1.5`` invariants could drift between agents.

:class:`ToolUsingAgent` owns those steps once, *above* :class:`~cyberlab_gen.agents.call_surface.AgentRunner`
(which owns the call mechanics). Subclasses supply only what differs — the capability, the output
schema, the user turn, and the output cap — and read the typed result. The invariants live here:

- ``registries`` is typed ``MergedRegistries`` (no ``object`` + runtime ``isinstance`` guard — the
  ``registries`` package imports neither ``agents`` nor ``framework``, so the type is safe);
- the model's typed output is **returned as data**; this contract never inspects it to decide
  control flow (that is the orchestrator's job, ``§1.5``).
